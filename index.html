                I'M SO HAPPY THAT GOD PUT YOU IN MY LIFE <3 I love you like I haven't loved anyone else, I met you in a period of my life when I got used to the idea of being single all my life, I thought that I'm never going to find the perfect girl, but one day everything changed, the first time we talked was so nice :) and talking to you became my favorite part of the day <3 I couldn't wait to get home and talk with you about school, I still remember the first time I asked and you said that it wasn't that good because you had pool day at school :/ and you said you didn't like it, from those conversations I realized that I started to like you, I just loved the way you talked to me and how you treated me, I realized that I love you before I even knew how you look like, and I'm so happy I did :) and the first time I saw you, it was on that story from insta, I thought that you are pretty <3 and you are really pretty :) from that point everything felt like a dream, a really nice dream, "she looks just like a dream, the prettiest girl I've ever seen " that's from a song I'm listening to while writing this :) I cant wait until the day that I'm going to wake up in the morning next to you, next to my pretty princess <3 yes we still have a lot of time until we can meet, but it's going to be worth it in the end, i can't wait to meet you Luna, i love you so much, you are perfect, it feels so good talking to you, your personality is AMAZING, you are funny, cute, smart, and your looks... just perfect, your hair is so pretty, your nose and lips sooooo cute, and your eyes are so so pretty, i could stare in them forever, and your smile, i love it so so so muchhhh, i always smile and no matter my mood i always become happy when i see your smile :) . I LOVE YOU PRINCESS, I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING <3
